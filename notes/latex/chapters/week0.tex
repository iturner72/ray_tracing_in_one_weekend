\subsection*{Thursday, 06/13/2023}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{DarkGreen}{\href{https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html}{course link}}
    \item shoutout to \textbf{\textcolor{Maroon}{TODO}} add x user that pointed
        me to this (shoutout ml btw (for you page))
        % todo add twitter user whomst this is from
    \item this is my very first c or cpp project (op says it's c flavored cpp) 
        beyond hello worlds and basic basic robotics stuff
    \item i love rust but i am not cracked at all so i would probably not be
        able to follow along in rust
    \item i will, however, follow op's advice to not copy pasta (besides most of 
        makefile compiler flags hehehe) and build it up slowly by typing along
    \item going to try my best to thug this out by Sunday
    \item test bib \cite{Shirley2024RTW1}
    \item bib working lets go
    \item important setup for fresh arch install (not in order, and just off the
        dome, i likely am forgetting tons of things)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item install unzip (will need for nvim clangd Mason lsp stuff)
            \item install cmake, clangd, gcc stuff
            \item setup debugger for nvim using dap, dap-ui, etc. 
            \item \textbf{build, compile, run:} (i think lol)
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item \texttt{cmake -B build/Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug} 
                    \item \texttt{cmake --build build/Debug} 
                    \item \texttt{build/rayTracing > image.ppm} 
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}
    \item op claims that if we can build project correctly in the beginning,
        then we are golden for rest of tutorial
    \item i hope this is true since the provided cmake file is cash money and
        really easy to get working with my setup
        (Figure~\ref{fig:rt_weekend_main_build_success})
    \item make \texttt{rtrace} aliase for build, compile, run, then open image
        in feh, probably terrible idea but whatever 
    \item got color header file with a \texttt{write_color} util function
    \item now working on a \texttt{ray} class which will use our \texttt{vec3} 
        class.
    \item refresher on rays: think of them as functions 
        (Equation~\ref{eq:rays}):
        \begin{equation}
            \mathbf{P}(t) = \mathbf{A} + t\mathbf{b}
            \label{eq:rays}
        \end{equation}
    \item here $\mathbf{P}$ is a 3D position along a line in 3D. $\mathbf{A}$ is
        the ray origin and $\mathbf{b}$ is the ray direction. The ray parameter
        $t$ is a real number (\texttt{double} in the code). Plug in a different
        $t$ and $\mathbf{P}(t)$ moves the point along the ray. Add in negative t
        values and you can go anywhere on the 3D line. For positive $t$, you get
        only the parts in front of $\mathbf{A}$, and this is what is often
        called a half-line or a ray. (Figure~\ref{fig:linear_interpolation}) 
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=7cm]{linear_interpolation}
            \captionsetup{labelfont=bf, textfont=it}
            \caption{linear interpolation}
            \label{fig:linear_interpolation}
        \end{figure}
    \item to make the actual ray tracer we will make simple camera with 16:9
        aspect ratio since it will be easier to debug $x$ and $y$ 
        transpositions.
    \item we need the height to be at least 1 since we divide width by height
        since it's easier to set the aspect ratio to width then divide by
        height. e.g. $width/height = 16/9 = 1.7778$
    \item apparently this is just an \textit{optimistic} (my words) ratio since 
        these values are not integers. we approximate the aspect ratio as best 
        we can by rounding height to the nearest integer (and don't allow it 
        to be less than one)
    \clearpage
    \item now we have a camera center in 3d space from which all the rays will
        originate (commonly referred to as the \textit{eye point}). we initially
        set the distance between the viewport of the camera center point to be
        one unit. This is often referred to as the \textit{focal length}.
    \item we will use \textit{right-handed coordinates} (right hand rule gang)
        Figure~\ref{fig:camera_rh_rule}
    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=9cm]{camera_rh_rule}
        \captionsetup{labelfont=bf, textfont=it}
        \caption{camera geometry}
        \label{fig:camera_rh_rule}
    \end{figure}
    \item unfortunately, the camera pose conflicts with the way we would like to
        render our image starting from the upper left pixel row by row scanning
        across from left to right. (Figure~\ref{fig:image_coord_system})
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=9cm]{image_coord_system}
            \captionsetup{labelfont=bf, textfont=it}
            \caption{viewport and pixel grid}
            \label{fig:image_coord_system}
        \end{figure}
    \item we have example 7x5 resolution image, the viewport upper left corner
        $\mathbf{Q}$, the pixel $\mathbf{P_{0,0}}$ location, the viewport vector
        $\mathbf{V_{u}}$ (viewport_u), the viewport vector $\mathbf{V_{v}}$
        (viewport_v), and the pixel delta vectors $\mathbf{\Delta u}$ and 
        $\mathbf{\Delta v}$.
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
